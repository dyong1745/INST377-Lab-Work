<!--Replace this with your complete HTML from Lab 1

Hook it up to CSS by including style.css in the <head> tag

Then add CSS class names to your HTML to make it look like the lab pictures.
For example: <div class="selector">

You should not need to edit the CSS to do this, only the HTML.

Don't forget to add an actual set of image descriptions to your image carousel.-->

              This image carousel features 4 variations of a mochi image that each represent different image file types. These showcase the strengthes of each image type.<br/>
              The first mochi &#40leftmost&#41 is a GIF, which is an image file type that supports short animations. Due to their limited number of colors, 
              the file size is quite small and can be loaded quickly on a webpage.<br/>
              The second mochi is a JPG, which is a very common image file type that is good for high resolution pictures. However, as the file size reduces, so does the image quality.
              There is a visible halo around this mochi because JPGs do not support transparent pixels.<br/>
              The third mochi is a PNG, which can provide a large variety colors and even transparency. The file can be compressed without losing image quality.<br/>
              The last mochi is a SVG, which is an image file type that is designed to render well no matter the size. They can work well with many different web standards like CSS, DOM, JS, etc.
            </p>
            <p>These four mochis also happen to be in a band together called "Ana-mochi-sis", and they will be releasing a new album very soon.</p>
