              The first mochi &#40left&#41 is a GIF, which is an image file type that supports short animations. Due to their limited number of colors, the file size is quite small and can be loaded quickly on a webpage.
              This mochi is bouncing up and down in a loop because it ate something delicious and is quite pleased. Its name is Matcha.
            </p>
            <p>
              The mochi next to Sam is a JPG, which is a very common image file type that is good for high resolution pictures. However, as the file size reduces, so does the image quality.
              There is a visible halo around this mochi because JPG does not support transparent pixels; moreover, this mochi has powers and can summon force fields. Its name is Mango.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third mochi is a PNG, which can provide a large variety colors and even transparency. The file can be compressed without losing image quality.
              This mochi is staying quite still, but there is absolute turmoil happening inside its mind. Its name is Taro.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last mochi is a SVG, which is an image file type that is designed to render well no matter the size. They can work well with many different web standards like CSS, DOM, JS, etc.
              This mochi is smaller than all the other mochis - about 75 x 75 pixels - but it has big dreams. Its name is Red Bean.
            </p>
            <p>These four mochis are in a band together called "Ana-mochi-sis", and they have recently released an album called <em>Boba Dreams</em>.</p>
